# Core module for airwire light wallets.

This is a java wrapper library for WIRE. Share common WIRE code between different apps/projects to prevent WET code and make things more DRY. Mainly in the context of light wallets. In the future this could be extended to a full implementation of WIRE node in java. But as this would be a huge endeavour and have many things in the route map already don't expect it in the near future - but PRs are accepted ;-)
